## Methods

- Spatial & temporal resolution
    - Spatial--microscope (high/fine resolution) vs. telescope (low/poor)
    - Temporal--stopwatch (high/fine) vs. calendar (low/poor)
- Structural vs. functional
- Invasive vs. non-invasive

## Methods (continued)

- MRI 
    - structural
      - diffusion tensor imaging-DTI
    - functional MRI-fMRI
- CT
- EEG & ERP, MEG
- Stimulation (chemical, electrical, magnetic, optical

## Neuroanatomy

- Meninges
- Directions & slices
- Hindbrain, midbrain, forebrain & ventricular landmarks
- Lobes of the cerebral cortex & some primary functions
- Fissures & sulci

## Neuroanatomy

- CNS vs. PNS
- Autonomic vs. somatic parts of PNS
- Sympathetic vs. parasympathetic divisions of the Autonomic Nervous System

## Cellular neuroscience

- Glia
  - Astrocytes, oligodendrocytes & Schwann cells, microglia
- Neuronal anatomy
  - Dendrites, soma, axons, axon terminals, synapse
- Resting potential -- what is it & why does it occur
    - $[K^+]$ story (where concentrated, direction of flow, effect on membrane voltage)
    + $[Na^+]$ story (where concentrated, direction of flow, effect on membrane voltage)
- Action potential and propagation -- how & why
    - threshold, rising phase, peak, falling phase, return to resting potential
